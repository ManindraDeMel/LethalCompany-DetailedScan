# DetailedScan
Type `detailed` in the terminal when landed at a moon to bring up a list of all of the scrap still remaining outside of the ship, and their individual value.
Due to the nature of how the terminal works, shortform commands like `det` also work.

This mod works client-side, but it takes a small amount of time to sync with the server when you first go to a moon if you are not the host. Item values in the detailed scan may appear as all '0' until the ship lands. If this happens, just back out of the terminal, then open it back up and re-enter the command.

## Installation
Use the [thunderstore mod manager](https://www.overwolf.com/app/Thunderstore-Thunderstore_Mod_Manager) or [r2modman](https://for-the-king.thunderstore.io/package/ebkr/r2modman/) to install.

Otherwise unzip this mod into your `Lethal Company/BepInEx/plugins` folder for manual installation
